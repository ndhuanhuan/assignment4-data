# MinHash LSH Document Deduplication Implementation
# 
# This module implements fuzzy document deduplication using MinHash signatures
# and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). The algorithm can detect both exact
# and near-duplicate documents efficiently, even when they have minor differences
# in formatting, punctuation, or word order.
#
# Key concepts:
# - MinHash: Creates compact fingerprints of documents while preserving similarity
# - LSH: Efficiently finds candidate duplicate pairs without comparing all documents
# - Jaccard Similarity: Measures overlap between document n-gram sets
#
# Reference: https://github.com/heng380/assignment4-data/blob/main/cs336_data/deduplication/minhash_dedup.py

    MinHash is a probabilistic technique that creates a compact "fingerprint"

    Algorithm:
    1. For each n-gram in the set, compute a hash value
    2. For each permutation (simulated by XOR with different seeds):
       - XOR the hash with the seed to simulate a different hash function
       - Keep track of the minimum hash value seen so far
    3. The final signature is the list of minimum hash values
    
    Mathematical property:
    P(min_hash_i(A) == min_hash_i(B)) = Jaccard_similarity(A, B)
    
    This means the probability that two documents have the same MinHash value
    for any given permutation equals their Jaccard similarity.

    This is the main function that orchestrates the entire MinHash LSH
    deduplication pipeline. It's a sophisticated algorithm that can find
    near-duplicate documents even when they have small differences.
    
    The algorithm works in several phases:
    
    1. **Signature Generation**: Compute MinHash signatures for all documents
       - Each document â low-dimensional fingerprint (num_hashes integers)
       - Signatures preserve similarity: similar docs â similar signatures
    
    2. **LSH Banding**: Group signatures into bands to find candidate pairs
       - Split each signature into num_bands sections
       - Documents with identical bands are candidate duplicates
       - This dramatically reduces the number of pairs to check
    
    3. **Candidate Pair Verification**: Compute exact Jaccard similarity
       - For each candidate pair, compute precise n-gram overlap
       - Only pairs above jaccard_threshold are considered duplicates
    
    4. **Clustering**: Group documents into duplicate clusters
       - Connected components: if AâB and BâC, then A,B,C are one cluster
       - Each cluster represents a set of near-duplicate documents
    
    5. **Output Selection**: Keep one representative from each cluster
       - Randomly select one document from each duplicate cluster
       - Copy all unique documents + representatives to output directory

        num_bands: Number of bands for LSH bucketing
                  Higher = more sensitive but more false positives
        ngrams: Length of word n-grams for text analysis (typical: 3-5)
        jaccard_threshold: Minimum similarity to consider documents duplicates
                          Range [0,1], typical: 0.7-0.9
        output_directory: Where to write deduplicated documents

    Mathematical Insight:

        will be detected as candidates is approximately:
